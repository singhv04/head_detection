1.set custom  anchor box using kmeans
2.set layers and stride for initial layers : 
	line 717 stride=2 to 4
	line 720 layers = -1, 36 to -1, 11
3.width and height : set network resolution to be 512*512, should be divisible by 32 and larger resolution helps better detection of small objects 
4.change jitter from 0.3 to 0 - it randomly crops and resizes images with changing aspect ratio from x
5.set resize from 1 to 0 :  In case of 1 image size of each iteration will be randomly from 320 to 512. If it is 0, the size of each training is the same as the input size

learning rate, policy 
learning_rate=0.001
burn_in=1000
policy=steps : policy for changing learning rate: constant (by default), sgdr, steps, step, sig, exp, poly, random (f.e., if policy=random - then current learning rate will be changed in this way = learning_rate * pow(rand_uniform(0,1), power)),
steps: 80% of max_batches, 90%of max batches
scale = 0.1, 0.1 : the learning rate will be reduced ten times on the basis of the previous learning rate each time it reaches the steps

ignore_thresh = .7 The parameter that decides whether to calculate the IOU error. If it is greater than thresh, the IOU error will not be caught in the cost function
